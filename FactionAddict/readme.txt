Description: 
============
Faction Addict is a stand-alone addon that provides additional faction information to your characters working towards faction based achievements. Intended for those players who work on gaining exalted with many factions but also helpful to those that do not. There are in game achievements for being exalted with 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, and 60 factions respectively.

Faction Addict also provides a reputation logging system that allows the player to see what reputation gains they have made in the current and previous sessions.

Use slash commands /fa or /factionaddict or click the new button on the upper right corner of your characters reputation panel to open and/or close the addon window.
