We should begin with some examples:
|cffff9900
- You want to create a rifle item with bullets item to charge it. Typically the rifle would be the main object, in which the bullet object would be an inner object for the rifle.

- A mail item opening a document. The document would be an inner object for the mail item.

- Creating quests: any item/document/cutscenes you use in a quest could be inner objects for this quest.

|rThe advantages of using inner objects are multiple:
|cff00ff00
- Inner objects data are really stored inside the parent object data. That mean they share the same version number, and their data are exchanged in the same time as the parent object data.

- You can freely determine the inner object ID, as it will use the parent object ID as prefix. You just can't have two inner objects having the same ID inside the same parent object.

- Using inner objects brings better performances.

- It's easier to manage and navigate through your objects if they are stored in parent objects. You can really see a parent object as a folder in which you store files.

|rSo it's simple: when you want to create an object, always ask yourself if it wouldn't be better to have it as an inner object for another item or a quest.

|cff00ff00Also: document and cutscenes can only be inner objects!]],

	Creating items and quests takes time and energy and it's always terrible when you lose all the hard work you have done.

	All add-ons in World of Warcraft can store data but there are limitations:

	• There is an unknown data size limit for add-on data (depending on the fact that you are running a 32 or 64 bits client, among other things).
	• Reaching this limit can wipe all the add-on saved data.
	• Kill the process, force-closing the game client (Alt+F4) or crashing can corrupt the add-on saved data.
	• Even if you exit the game correctly, there is always a chance that the game doesn't succeed to save the add-on data and corrupt it.

	In regards to all of that, we STRONGLY recommand to regularely backup your add-on saved data.

	You can find here a tutorial about finding all saved data:
	{link*https://totalrp3.info/documentation/how_to/saved_variables*Where are my information stored?}

	You can find here a tutorial about syncing your data to a cloud service:
	{link*https://totalrp3.info/documentation/how_to/backup_and_sync_profiles*How to backup and synchronize your add-ons settings using a cloud service}

	Please understand that we won't reply anymore to comment or ticket relative to a data wipe.
	It's not because we don't want to help but because we can't do anything to restore wiped data.

	Thank you, and enjoy Total RP 3 Extended!

Creating items and quests takes time and energy and it's always terrible when you lose all the hard work you have done.
All add-ons in World of Warcraft can store data but there are limitations:
• There is an unknown data size limit for add-on data (depending on the fact that you are running a 32 or 64 bits client, among other things).
• Reaching this limit can wipe all the add-on saved data.
• Kill the process, force-closing the game client (Alt+F4) or crashing can corrupt the add-on saved data.
• Even if you exit the game correctly, there is always a chance that the game doesn't succeed to save the add-on data and corrupt it.
In regards to all of that, we STRONGLY recommend to regularely backup your add-on saved data.
You can find here a tutorial about finding all saved data:
{link*https://totalrp3.info/documentation/how_to/saved_variables*Where is my information stored?}
You can find here a tutorial about syncing your data to a cloud service:
{link*https://totalrp3.info/documentation/how_to/backup_and_sync_profiles*How to backup and synchronize your add-ons settings using a cloud service}
Please understand we will no longer reply to comments or tickets relating to data wipes.
It's not because we don't want to help but because we can't do anything to restore wiped data.
Thank you, and enjoy Total RP 3 Extended!

- A mail item opening a document. The document would be an inner object for the mail item.
- Creating quests: any item/document/cutscenes you use in a quest could be inner objects for this quest.
|rThe advantages of using inner objects are multiple:

- Inner objects data are really stored inside the parent object data. That means they share the same version number, and their data is exchanged in the same time as the parent object data.

- Using inner objects brings better performance.
- It's easier to manage and navigate through your objects if they are stored in parent objects. You can really see a parent object as a folder in which you store files.

Gegenstände und Quests zu erstellen beansprucht Zeit und Energie und es ist immer furchtbar, wenn man all seine schwere Arbeit verliert.
Alle Addons in World of Warcraft können Daten speichern, aber es gibt Einschränkungen:
• Es gibt eine nicht bekannte Größenbegrenzung für Addon-Daten (unter anderem davon abhängig, ob du die 32- oder 64-Bit-Version benutzt).
• Wird diese Begrenzung erreicht, können sämtliche gespeicherten Addon-Daten gelöscht werden.
• Wenn der Spielprozess beendet wird (Alt+F4) oder abstürzt können gespeicherte Daten korrumpiert werden.
• Selbst wenn das Spiel ordnungsgemäß beendet wird kann es vorkommen, dass das Spiel nicht in der Lage ist alle Daten richtig zu speichern und sie so zu korrumpieren.
In dieser Hinsicht empfehlen wir DRINGEND regelmäßige Sicherungskopien anzulegen.
Unter folgendem Link findest du ein Tutorial (englisch), das dir hilft, deine gespeicherten Daten zu finden: {link*https://totalrp3.info/documentation/how_to/saved_variables*Where is my information stored?}
Hier findest du ein Tutorial (englisch) über die Datensynchronisation mit einem Cloud-Service: {link*https://totalrp3.info/documentation/how_to/backup_and_sync_profiles*How to backup and synchronize your add-ons settings using a cloud service}

La création d'objets et quêtes prend du temps et de l'énergie, et c'est toujours tragique de perdre tout ce dur labeur accompli...

Tous les add-ons de World of Warcraft peuvent stocker des données mais il y a des limites :

• Il y a une limite de taille des données, pour les données d'add-on, qui est inconnue (dépend de si vous tournez sur un client 32 ou 64 bits, entre autres).
• Atteindre cette limite peut balayer d'un coup toutes les données enregistrées d'add-on.
• "Killer" le processus, fermer le jeu de force (Alt+F4) ou crasher peut corrompre les données enregistrées d'add-on.
• Même si vous quittez le jeu proprement, il existe toujours une chance que le jeu ne parvienne pas à sauvegarder les données d'add-on, et les corrompe.

Au regard de tout ceci, nous recommandons FORTEMENT de sauvegarder ailleurs, régulièrement, vos données enregistrées d'add-on.

Vous trouverez ici un tutoriel sur la façon de retrouver toutes les données enregistrées :
{link*https://totalrp3.info/documentation/how_to/saved_variables*Where are my information stored?}

Vous trouverez ici un tutoriel sur la façon de synchroniser vos données avec un service de "cloud" :
{link*https://totalrp3.info/documentation/how_to/backup_and_sync_profiles*How to backup and synchronize your add-ons settings using a cloud service}

Veuillez comprendre que nous ne répondrons plus aux commentaires ni aux requêtes relevant d'une perte de données.
Ce n'est pas parce que nous ne voulons pas aider, mais parce que nous ne pouvons techniquement rien faire pour restaurer des données perdues.

Merci, et profitez bien de Total RP 3 Extended !

Prenons quelques exemples :
|cffff9900
- Vous voulez créer un fusil avec des objets "balles" pour le recharger. Typiquement, le fusil serait l'objet principal, donc l'élément-mère, dans lequel la balle serait l'élément interne.

- Un objet de courrier ouvrant un document. Le document (une lettre, par exemple) serait l'élément interne, conçu pour l'objet de courrier (une enveloppe, par ex.).

- Création de quêtes : tous les objets/documents/cinématiques que vous employez dans une quête peuvent être de tels "élément interne", s'ils sont justement conçus pour cette quête.

|rLes avantages à employer des éléments internes sont multiples :
|cff00ff00
- Les données des éléments internes sont vraiment hébergées à l'intérieur des données de l'élément-mère. Ce qui signifie qu'ils partagent le même numéro de version, et que leurs données sont échangées en même temps que celles de leur élément-mère.

- Employer des éléments internes apporte plus de performances.

- Il est plus simple de gérer vos éléments et d'y naviguer s'ils sont hébergés dans des éléments-mères. Vous pouvez vraiment voir un élément-mère comme un dossier dans lequel vous insérez des fiches.

|rDonc c'est simple : chaque fois que vous voulez créer un élément, demandez-vous si ça ne serait pas plus efficace d'en faire un élément interne, attribué à un autre objet ou à une quête qui lui est lié(e).

Empecemos con algunos ejemplos:
|cffff9900
- Quieres crear un objeto que sea un rifle con objetos que hagan de balas para cargarlo. El rifle sería el objeto principal, mientras que las balas serían los objetos internos para el rifle.
- Un objeto de correo que abra un documento. El documento sería el objeto interno y el correo el principal.
- Creando misiones: cualquier objeto/documento/excena que uses en una misión podrían ser objetos internos de la misión.
|rLas ventajas de usar objetos internos son múltiples:
|cff00ff00
- La información de los objetos internos se almacena dentro de la información del objeto principal. Eso significa que comparten el mismo número de versión y que su información se intercambia a la vez que la información del objeto principal.
- Puedes determinar libremente la ID del objeto interno dado que usará la ID del objeto principal como prefijo, ya que no puedes tener dos objetos internos con la misma ID dentro del mismo objeto principal.
- Usar un objeto interno mejora el rendimiento.
- Es más fácil administrar y navegar a través de objetos si están guardados en objetos principales. Puedes ver un objeto principal como si fuera una carpeta en la que guardaras archivos.
|rAsí que es fácil: cuando quieras crear un objeto, pregúntate si no sería mejor tenerlo como objeto interno para otro objeto o misión.

创造物品和任务是非常消耗精力的一件事，所以存储丢失是非常悲剧的。

这里可以存储所有你在wow里创造的东西，当然它是有限制的：
*所有附加数据都有一个未知的数据大小限制（取决于运行32或64位客户端，还有其他杂七杂八）
*达到或者超过这个限制会删除所有数据
*杀死进程，强制关闭客户端（alt+f4）会损坏已经保存的数据
*即使你正确退出游戏，但有时仍有可能游戏不能成功保存数据并损坏数据
*顺便说下这玩意和MyRolePlay（另一个人物卡RP插件）冲突 
*顺便说下存储机制是一个账号下所有角色存一个地方，所以精分太多可能容易崩溃，目前存储限制尚不清楚

正因如此，我们强烈建议你备份保存所有数据。
数据保存位置参见:
{link*https://totalrp3.info/documentation/how_to/saved_variables*我的信息存在哪里?}
{h2:c}直接备份“WTF\Account\你的角色名\SavedVariables” 下所有内容就行了{/h2}
主要是totalRP3.lua 配置存档/totalrp3_data.lua数据存档/totalrp3_storyline.lua

你可以在这里找到关于同步您的数据到云服务教程:
{link*https://totalrp3.info/documentation/how_to/backup_and_sync_profiles*如何云同步数据？}
需要一些满足版本迭代的云同步如Google Driver你们上不去我就不管了 O(∩_∩)O~

反正你数据没了我们不能恢复。

創造物品和任務的過程非常消耗精力，所以存檔消失總是令人痛心疾首。

這裡可以存儲所有你在wow裡創造的東西，雖然它是有限制的：
※所有附加資料都有一個未知的資料大小限制（取決於運行32或64位用戶端，等等…）
※達到或者超過這個限制會刪除所有資料。
※強制關閉程式（alt+f4／Kill Process）會損壞已經保存的資料。
※即使你正確退出遊戲，但遊戲有時仍不能成功保存資料且損壞資料。
※順便說下這玩意和MyRolePlay（另一個RP外掛程式）衝突。
※存儲機制是一個帳號下所有角色存一個地方，所以精分太多可能容易崩潰，目前存儲限制尚不清楚。

正因如此，我們強烈建議你備份保存所有資料！

資料保存位置參見:
{link*https://totalrp3.info/documentation/how_to/saved_variables*Where is my information stored?}
{h2:c}直接備份“WTF\Account\你的角色名\SavedVariables” 下的所有內容就行了。{/h2}
主要是「/totalRP3.lua」
配置存檔「/totalrp3_data.lu」
數據存檔「/totalrp3_storyline.lua」

你可以在以下網址搜尋關於雲端保存的教學：
{link*https://totalrp3.info/documentation/how_to/backup_and_sync_profiles*How to backup and synchronize your add-ons settings using a cloud service？}

需要一些滿足版本反覆運算的雲端同步例如Google Driver你們上不去我就不管了 O(∩_∩)O~

反正你資料沒了我們不能恢復。
特此感謝︿(￣︶￣)︿。
